00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:29,519
thank you [Music]

2
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,040
in this video you will learn the fundamentals of the Godot gaming engine

3
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,960
we will start with the program setup and its key Concepts from there we will

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,820
cover a broad range of topics like Tire Maps animation players lights particle

5
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,800
effects shaders and user interfaces we will also cover more advanced topics

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,360
like skeleton animations and pathfinding if none of these words mean anything to

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,559
you don't worry I'm going to explain everything from scratch either way by

8
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,799
the end of the video you should have a strong understanding of how to create

9
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,240
basically any 2D game in Godot and you will also have a really good foundation

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,040
to start with 3D games before we begin a huge shout out to the sponsor of this

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,200
video not pass business when making a game you will end up with a lot of data

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,580
and backing all of that up is a nightmare you want to access your data

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,960
from anywhere from any operating system it should be convenient and it should be

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,560
secure both from hackers and from your house burning down

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,060
especially security is a major concern having my accounts hacked would be a

16
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,600
disaster for me and if it can happen to a large organization like city project

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,100
red or Linus Tech tips it could happen to me it could happen to you or it could

18
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,579
happen to your company not past business is an excellent

19
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,479
solution for all of that it safely stores your passport in one accessible

20
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,979
location and even enters your login credentials for you this makes it super

21
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,700
easy to save your game projects both on GitHub and Google Drive and have access

22
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,619
to them everywhere in the world it even lets you identify weak passwords and it

23
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,060
checks if any of your existing passwords has been leaked online on top of that

24
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,319
you can also set up biometric identification and use multi-factor

25
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,220
authentification notepass business also works with

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,660
unlimited passports including Wi-Fi credentials and credit cards so even for

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,780
things Beyond work it can be incredibly useful

28
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,440

32
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,940
it out all right let's get started first of all

33
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,879
what is Kudo and how does it help you make a game

34
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,560
Fido is a game engine which means it is an app that lets you display images play

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,760
sounds capture user input and stuff like that the dough can do even more advanced

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,140
things like physics calculations pathfinding skeleton animations and

37
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,340
networking for multiplayer games all you have to do is to combine the various

38
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,739
Concepts and then create your game this could either be a 2d or a 3D game

39
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,360
Godot supports both other game engines you may have heard of are unity and

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,620
unreal there are hundreds of engines But ultimately they all do basically the

41
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,860
same thing one major advantage of Godot is that it

42
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,659
is entirely free and Community developed you never have to pay for anything you

43
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,140
don't have to sign away your soul in some legal text you don't even have to

44
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,760
create an account all you have to do is go to godotengine.com and click on

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,599
download latest then you can select a version that fits your operating system

46
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,860
although Godot will likely detect the right version for you on the website so

47
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,340
just click on Godot engine and you should be good with that you are

48
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,959
downloading a zip file and if you extract that you get two files one is

49
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,959
Godot itself the other would open a console

50
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,400
you can use the latter one for debugging but I would just ignore it so I'll just
